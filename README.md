# Simple HTML Resume Mockup
For my first project I decided to create a simple resume mockup using HTML5.
Doing this allowed me to learn about essential HTML tags, inline styling, using the inspect feature in browers and to get familiar with documentation such as [DevDocs API documentation](https://devdocs.io/) and [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML).
The code was written in Visual Studio Code and inspected in Google Chrome.

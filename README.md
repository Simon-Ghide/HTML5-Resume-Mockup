# Simple HTML Resume Mockup
For my first project I decided to create a simple resume mockup using HTML5.
Doing this allowed me to learn about essential HTML tags, inline styling and using the inspect feature in browers using the DevDocs API documentation (https://devdocs.io/) and MDN web docs (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML).
The code was written in Visual Studio Code and run in Google Chrome.
